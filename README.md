# Anime Recommendation System 🎬✨

This is an **Anime Recommendation System** where users are recommended anime based on their preferences and ratings. The system utilizes a **Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm**, combining both **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** to provide accurate suggestions tailored to individual users.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- For new users, the system uses a **Trending Algorithm** to recommend anime based on global user ratings and view counts.
- The project is developed using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

## 📊 Recommendation Approach
1. **Hybrid Recommendation System**:
   - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends anime similar to those the user has previously liked.
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests anime based on the preferences of users with similar tastes.
2. **Trending Algorithm** (Cold Start Problem):
   - For new users with no prior interactions, recommendations are based on global popularity, ratings, and view counts.
